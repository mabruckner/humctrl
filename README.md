humctrl
=======

`humctrl` analyzes audio streams in real time, identifying target sequences of intervals. Upon
detection, `humctrl` can trigger other operations via http request. Currently only two hard-coded
sequences are provided. These sequences are coded to interact with a Philips hue system.

This program allows me to sing my lights on and off.
